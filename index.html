		<h2>A Little About Lexx...</h2>

		<p>My name is Alexandria, but you can call me Lexx! I am a Houston based web designer and currently studying Web Design and Development at Full Sail University! I am also enrolled in Free Code Camp working for my Front End Development Certificate and my Full Stack Development Certificate. This allows me to get extra practice and develop my skills in different areas. I am excited to update my portfolio as I grow and expand my skills!</p>

			<h2>Navigation Bar</h2>
			<h3>What I Hope to Learn</h3>
			<p>I know the basics of creating a nav, but I would like to add animation to my navigation. I like how in the above example it seems to have a 3D effect as you scroll over it.</p>
			<h3>How Does This Relate To What I Have Learned</h3>
			<p>I feel like this would help step up my css skills. I will be able to create new lists and navs with animation to seperate them from others. I currently know some of the animation properties and this would help me practice.</p>

			<h2>Video Background Header/Hero Image</h2>
			<h3>What I Want to Learn</h3>
			<p>I want to learn how to add a video background instead of using a hero image on a page. This would create an attention grabbing landing page and allow me to use videos in future website.</p>
			<h3>How Does This Relate To What I Have Learned</h3>
			<p>I have learned how to add videos and how to create hero images. Now I have to combine them both efficently to create this look and also see how to change the video to image if used for mobile so that It does not overload mobile or handheld devices.</p>
