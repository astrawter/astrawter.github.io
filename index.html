			<h2>Navigation Bar</h2>
			<h3>What I Hope to Learn</h3>
			<p>I know the basics of creating a nav, but I would like to add animation to my navigation. I like how in the above example it seems to have a 3D effect as you scroll over it.</p>
			<h3>How Does This Relate To What I Have Learned</h3>
			<p>I feel like this would help step up my css skills. I will be able to create new lists and navs with animation to seperate them from others. I currently know some of the animation properties and this would help me practice.</p>

			<h2>Footer</h2>
			<h3>What I Hope to Learn</h3>
			<p>I want to learn how to add the CTA of the newsletter and give it the appearance of being outside normal boundaries. I like how it overlaps the two sections and I also like creating images that stay in position as you scroll.</p>
			<h3>How Does This Relate To What I Have Learned</h3>
			<p>I know how to create the basic elements within this footer example. I just want to learn to elevate my CSS styling to create out of the normal constraints of sectioning.</p>

			<h2>Video Background Header/Hero Image</h2>
			<h3>What I Want to Learn</h3>
			<p>I want to learn how to add a video background instead of using a hero image on a page. This would create an attention grabbing landing page and allow me to use videos in future website.</p>
			<h3>How Does This Relate To What I Have Learned</h3>
			<p>I have learned how to add videos and how to create hero images. Now I have to combine them both efficently to create this look and also see how to change the video to image if used for mobile so that It does not overload mobile or handheld devices.</p>
			<h3>How I Will Build This</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Create the component as a Header</li>
				<li>Create a div with an ID to add the video to</li>
				<li>Create a nav within the header to contain the links</li>
				<li>create a ul with li as the navigation links</li>
				<li>add video to the div</li>
				<li>Css styling to make the video cover the full page</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Style Guide</h3>
